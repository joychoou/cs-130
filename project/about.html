        <h1>What is CAPS?</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). CAPS serves as the primary mental health service at Northwestern University with offices on both the Evanston and Chicago campuses. 
            CAPS provides a set of core services, including clinical services, educational workshops, and consultation with faculty, staff, and parents.

            <br><br>There is no charge for CAPS services. CAPS is based on a short-term model. 
            All full-time matriculated students who come to CAPS will receive a personalized care plan tailored to their specific needs. 
            Care plan meetings will be used to determine the best fit between students' needs 
            and all available CAPS and community resources to ensure the best possible treatment outcome.
            A personalized care plan may result in one or more of the following outcomes:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Short-term individual counseling at CAPS; </li>
            <li>Group therapy at CAPS;</li>
            <li>Connection to other on-campus programs/services;</li>
            <li>Connection to specialized and optimal community providers/care, facilitated by a CAPS provider;</li>
            <li>Referral to CAPS workshops or other educational programming;</li>
            <li>Here is how you can schedule your first appointment at CAPS.</li> 
        </ol>

        <h1>Diversity Value Statement</h1>
        <p>Northwestern CAPS is fully committed to providing services that affirm the dignity, worth, and value of all individuals. 
            We believe in creating an atmosphere of openness, trust, respect, and safety where diverse attitudes, 
            beliefs, values, and behaviors can be explored and discussed. We seek to understand and honor individual differences, 
            including but not limited to experiences related to: race, ethnicity, national origin, religious and spiritual beliefs, 
            gender, sexuality, physical and mental abilities, size and appearance, and socio-economic status.</p> 
        <p>Mental health concerns are often affected by social forces in the environment related to power and privilege,
        such as racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, heterosexism, and other forms of marginalization and oppression. 
        Often pervasive and institutionalized, these forces are unacknowledged in many settings, 
        leaving the impacted individuals to feel alone, voiceless, and invalidated. 
        Our staff and trainees consider these forces in the struggles of students who seek help at CAPS,
         and actively address them in a culturally sensitive manner, employing approaches that include empowerment and advocacy.</p>
        <p>Our commitment to culturally sensitive communications extends to interactions with colleagues, trainees, faculty, staff, 
        parents, and the greater local, national, and international community. We strive to make CAPS an open, affirming,
        and safe working environment in which all parties feel understood, valued, and accepted. 
        We take personal and organizational responsibility to grow in our awareness, reduce barriers and bias, and strengthen our multicultural competence.</p>
        <p>We understand that inclusiveness and social justice require an ongoing endeavor, and we can never assume to have reached the final point. At times, values may conflict, but we are committed to supporting and challenging each other through difficult dialogues. 
            Courage and empathy are necessary building blocks for a community in which differences are celebrated.</p>
